Global Definitions

This directory contains templates that describe the common elements of this
deployments, to be shared (and possibly overridden) by sites and environments.
The templates are merged in the following order:

  global/jobs.yml             Specify what jobs will make up the canonical
                              deployment, and what templates to apply to them.

  global/deployment.yml       Define the global structure of all deployments
                              with the correct param calls to remind template
                              writers to override the correct things.

  global/properties.yml       Define the properties (global or per-job) for this
                              deployment.


NOTE: If you make changes to the templates in here, they will automatically
propagate to any newly-created environments, but you will need to run a
refresh for existing environments to receive those updates.
